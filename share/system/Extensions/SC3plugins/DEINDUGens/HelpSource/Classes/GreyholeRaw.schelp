DESCRIPTION::
An algorithmic delay. 

Developed as part of the LINK::Overviews/DEIND:: project.


CLASSMETHODS::
private:: categories

METHOD:: ar

argument::in1
Left channel

argument::in2
Right channel

argument::damping
Controls damping of high-frequencies as the delay decays. 0 is no damping, 1 is very strong damping (0..1)

argument::delaytime
Sets approximate delay time in seconds. (0.1..60)

argument::diffusion
Sets shape of the diffusion unit. Values greater than 0.707 produce smooth exponential decay. Lower values produce a slower build-up of echoes. (0..1)

argument::feedback
amount of feedback for the delay line. (0..1)

argument::moddepth
Sets depth of delay-line modulation in samples. Use in combination with mFreq to set amount of chorusing within the structure. (0..50)

argument::modfreq
Sets frequency of delay-line modulation. Use in combination with mDepth to set amount of chorusing within the structure. (0..10)

argument::size
Scales size of delay-lines within the diffusion unit, producing the impression of a larger or smaller space. Values below 1 can sound quite metallic. (0.5..5)

returns::
A UGen.

EXAMPLES::

a plot:
code:: { LFPulse.ar(Line.kr(100, 800, 0.1)) }.plot(0.1); ::

50 Hz wave:
code:: { LFPulse.ar(50) * 0.1 }.play; ::
